# Console X
This is a work in progress and in-development experimental application which will alow you to play several thousand games, as well as give some information on them, different game variants (e.g. hacked versions) and more! Currently we are working on giving support to playing all web based and browser games, and maybe in the future access to retro and old / open-source games.

## What games are we going to add?
* Flash, HTML5 and other browser based games
* Old and "retro" games that are available
* Open source games from desktop or console
* Mobile games / mobile and tablet emulation
